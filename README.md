# AutoML
CSC1028 AutoML project

When running the audio classifiers with the predownloaded datasets, train_test_split1 is related to the Cat_&_Dog_Audio_Classification file,
set_a_adjusted is used in relation to the Generalised_Audio_Classifier file and the Tabular_Audio_Classification file, and finally, the esch50 file is related 
to the Generalised_Tabular_Audio_Classification file.

The image based models rely on a csv file containing the filename and label for the dataset in order to run correctly, the headings are passed as a user input 
and aren't fixed.

Within the tabular models, the csv meta data files must use the column headings 'filename' and 'label', due to the preprocessing methods employed.
