    1.0.0 About
</h1>
<p>
In January 2021 I began working on the Auto Machine Learning project which aims to reduce the time spent identifying and searching for suitable architectures to apply to a model by creating an automated system which sets out to make machine learning accessible to everyone. This system will incorporate a range of architectures from across the field of machine learning with the main to create a user-friendly interface for training state of the art machine learning models.
</p>
<p>
    Whilst machine learning refers to a broad range of fields such as Image
    Recognition, Natural Language Processing and Time Series Prediction, my
    aims for the project are to investigate the application in a time series
    perspective but rather than the traditional forecasting models, I am
    exploring the use of an audio classifier in event recognition systems, a
    field that has yet to be fully developed within the fastAi community thus
    providing me with the potential to generate a useful system that could
    prove beneficial for developers in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout this project I have been using the Google Colab development
    platform to overcome the intense hardware requirements of machine learning
    training and allow for the system to be accessible by all users and have
    been reliant on the fastAi, fastbook and fastaudio libraries to allow for
    the processing and analysis of audio systems in a machine learning context.
</p>
<p>
    For those new to Google Colab, I have created a basic guide on getting
    started within the platform here:
