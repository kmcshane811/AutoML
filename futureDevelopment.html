    5.0.0 Future Development
</h1>
<p>
    At present, whilst the system is functional and meeting the functional
    requirements of the specification, there are several enhancements to be
    made.
</p>
<p>
    Firstly, in order to allow the system to fulfil all functional requirements,
	the first development must be the implementation of the tabular prediction 
	method. As tabular models are typically used for predictive modelling in 
	regression models, classification prediction applications are uncommon but 
	in finding a soloution to this problem, the system opens a range of new uses
	for future users beyond the context of audio classification.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, it is essential to find a method that enables non-cuda based system
    to run the project without the need to make any large-scale changes to the
    drivers or frameworks of the GPU. Whilst systems such as Ubuntu and WSL are
	more flexible with running Cuda within virtual machines, over coming this 
	problem on windows may take some time but will yield a positive output.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, the creation of the venv on the end-userâ€™s device increases the
    storage requirements of the system and creates a dependency on internet
    connection to download the relevant dependencies. Furthermore, the system
    is dependent on python 3.8 to operate meaning that if users do not have
    this specific python version installed, they cannot use the system. To
    alleviate these inefficiencies, it is worth exploring the conversion of .py
    files to.exe files which encapsulate all relevant files and dependencies
    within one executable file thus removing the need for specific python
    versions and the virtual environment.
</p>
<p>
    Fourthly, once the local system is deployable and accessible by all
    interested users it would be beneficial to explore the deployment of the
    programme as a docker GPU image which can be deployed as a flask webserver,
    allowing a web interface to be generated to the code for both local and
    cloud-based processing. This will open the pool of potential users as the
    traditional hardware limitations of ai will not make an impact to the user
    on the cloud-based systems.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the ability to convert the trained model through ONNX would enable
    the deployment of the ai models within C++ applications, promoting a range
    of new potential applications that can be made wildly available to assist
    users, both specialist and general, in multiple fields, enabling them to
    boost their productivity and overall performance.
